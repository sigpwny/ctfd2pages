# ctfd2pages

Links rot, which would be especially sad when you have a beautifully themed
CTFd website :(. None of the existing CTFd archival technologies archive the
entire website and keep it browsable; in most cases, they only archive the
handouts and the challenge descriptions.

This is why we created ctfd2pages. Github Pages can now host a static version
of a CTFd site long after the CTF event is over.

Challenges that need special hosting requirements, such as netcat-based
challenges, are not in scope of this project, unfortunately. Though I guess
you can try to figure the challenges out from the given handouts (if any) or
public releases of challenge source code repositories (if available).

### Examples

A ~~picture~~ live site is worth a thousand words:

- UIUCTF [2020](https://2020.uiuc.tf/), [2021](https://2021.uiuc.tf/),
  [2022](https://2022.uiuc.tf/), [2023](https://2023.uiuc.tf/)
- MapleCTF [2022](https://ctf2022.maplebacon.org/)
- SekaiCTF [2022](https://2022.ctf.sekai.team/)
- KITCTFCTF [2022](https://2022.ctf.kitctf.de/) GPNCTF21 [2023](https://gpn21.ctf.kitctf.de/)
- (Feel free to send us a PR and add yours here)

## Usage

It's mostly just bash and JavaScript. To install JS dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This tool is separated into many stages, each does a different operation.
To see usage information:

```bash
$ ./stage
Usage: ./stage [stage number]
Stages:

  ./stage 00            init
  ./stage 01            scrape
  ./stage 02            json_resolve
[...]
```

Each stage will operate on the git repository, but will not push unless
otherwise specified. To see what each stage does check `run.sh` for the
commit title, and `stage.sh` for the executed commands.

need help or have any questions.

### GitHub Pages Setup

Follow [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
In particular, you need to setup a `CNAME` DNS record on your DNS provider to
`<user>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io`. You also need to set the
"Custom domain" setting under GitHub Pages settings for the repository.
